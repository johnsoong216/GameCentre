##[Team Contract]:I will get my allotted work done on time.
                  I will attend every team meeting and actively participate.
                  Should an emergency arise that prevents me from attending a team meeting,
                  I will notify my team immediately.
                  The work will be divided roughly equally among all team members.
                  I will help my team to understand every concept in the project.
                  If I do not understand a concept or code, I will immediately ask my team for help.
